# -Implementing-and-Evaluating-KNN-and-SVM-Classifiers

Developed a Python executable, which includes a class that trains and tests KNN and SVM classifiers based on the user's needs and dataset. 

Implemented both classifiers from scratch, along with leveraging the scikit-learn library for comparison purposes.

Utilized two datasets for testing: the Sonar Dataset (predicting if an object is a mine or rock) and the Banknote Dataset (predicting if a banknote is authentic).

Ensured automatic data splitting into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function without any manual data manipulation.
